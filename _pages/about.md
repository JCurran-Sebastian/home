Hey! I'm Jacob, I'm a mathematician from Norwich, UK, currently doing a postdoc in the Department of Global Health at the University of Copenhagen. My main academic interests are in stochastic models of infectious disease transmission and evolution, but I also have a number of side interests, including using Lie Algebras in applied settings and in Topological Data Analysis.
